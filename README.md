# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was developed as a Demo for React and MongoDB Realm (App-Services).



# Tutorial Steps:


### Create project with React 
 npx create-react-app APP_NAME

### Open VSC on new project folder
 cd APP_NAME
 code .

### Remove unused files and Remove files (Edit: index.js, App.js. Delete: reportWebVitals, setupTests, App.test.js, logo.svg, logo192.png, logo512.png )

### Create a new App Service App and link to the Database Source (Cluster) or create One

### Copy and save App ID 

### Click on Authentication > Authentication Providers, enable "Allow users to log in anonymously", Save Draft.

### Click on Rules and Set up read&write for the target collection (Select collection and click Add preset role)


### Click in Functions, 
 - in Settings Create New Function getAllData  (optionally Log Function Arguments), 
 - In Function Editor, add code targeting the Source, Database and Collection and Save Draft
 (i.e.)

### Click on (Realm) SDK to follow instructions and sample code for Language, in this case Js-Web and install in Project:
 npm install --save realm-web

### Add Code to App.js (or Controller code), we can use the sample functions or our own bussiness logic



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
